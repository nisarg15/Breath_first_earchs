## Introduction 
This file includes Python program solution for BFS for
UMD ENPM 661 Spring 2022 batch. The folders consist of a python
program along with generated outputs as .txt files.
  
   This project will have given 2 cases for a 8 number/block puzzle with BFS 
  (Breadth Force Search) algorithm. It will generate the path in the console as well
  as in a separate .txt file with the name CaseX.txt where X is the number of that case.
  
    Note that the program generates the .txt file, so if you run the program, there is no need to download the file.
	
#### These files are executable:
  * Case 1.py
  * Case 2.py

 
#### These following files are the .txt output
  * Case 1 nodepath.txt
  * Case 2 nodepath.txt

 
## Requirements
       ***Important*********************************************************************
       *If the text file does not appear run the program twice
       * Make sure to change the output path of the text file when running the code
       *********************************************************************************
       
### To run this code following libraries are required

* Copy

### Running code in Ubuntu
After installing dependencies, 
Make sure that current working directory is same as the directory of the program,
You can change the working directory by using **cd** command.

* Run the following command which will generate a solution for Case 1
````
python Case 1.py
````
* Run the following command which will generate a solution for Case 2
````
python Case 2.py
````

It is important to note that if both Python files are in different directory
we have to change to the correct directory again.


### Troubleshooting ###
	Most of the cases the issue will be incorrect working directory.
	Double check the path by typing **pwd** command in console
	Also change the path of the .txt files.
    This will output the current working directory.
    Check if it is same as the python file location.
